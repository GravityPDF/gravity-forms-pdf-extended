==========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GravityPDF/gravity-pdf.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/GravityPDF/gravity-pdf) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/GravityPDF/gravity-pdf/branch/development/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/GravityPDF/gravity-pdf)

Gravity PDF is a GPLv2-licensed WordPress plugin that allows you to automatically generate, email and download PDF documents using the popular form-builder plugin, [Gravity Forms](https://rocketgenius.pxf.io/c/1211356/445235/7938) (affiliate link). Find out more about Gravity PDF at [https://gravitypdf.com](https://gravitypdf.com/).

# About

This Git repository is for developers who want to contribute to Gravity PDF. **Don't use it in production**. For production use, [download Gravity PDF from the WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-pdf-extended/).

The `development` branch is considered our bleeding edge branch, with all new changes pushed to it. The `master` branch is our latest stable version of Gravity PDF.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
* Docker Desktop ([Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) or [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)) / [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/) or [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Setup for Docker 

The Docker setup will create a fully functionality development environment preconfigured for Gravity PDF. 

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/GravityPDF/gravity-pdf/` from the terminal
1. Copy and rename `.env.example` to `.env`, then replace `00000000000000000000000000000000` with a valid Gravity Forms license key 
1. Run `yarn prebuild` and `yarn build:production`
1. Start Docker Desktop (or run `docker-machine start && eval $(docker-machine env)` if using Docker Toolbox)
1. Run `yarn env:install`, then wait for the Docker environment to start-up
1. If successful, you will now have a fully-functional development environment setup with Gravity Forms and Gravity PDF. The URL and login details will be shown in the terminal.

If you shutdown Docker and want to fire up the environment later, use `yarn env start`. You can also reset the database back to its original state with `yarn env:reset`. 

### Enable X-Debug
#### For Windows users: 

To enable X-Debug in the containers. You need to set the environmental variables before starting up Docker:
* `export LOCAL_PHP_XDEBUG=true`
* If running **Docker Toolbox** you'll need to manually set the host IP address: `export XDEBUG_HOST_IP=10.0.0.1`
NOTE: Change the IP `10.0.0.1` to the value of`$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` when you load up the Docker-powered site.

If youâ€™ve brought up the containers already, run `yarn env stop` and `yarn env start` to reboot after setting the variable.

#### For Linux users:

Run the command `ip a` and find the `docker0` network interface. Copy the inet value.
e.g. `inet 172.17.0.1/16`, and then include these variables when you start your docker machine.

* e.g `LOCAL_PHP_XDEBUG=true XDEBUG_HOST_IP=172.17.0.1 yarn env start`.

When you do your Path Mappings in your IDE, make sure to name your server `localhost` to do CLI debugging (including PHPUnit via `yarn test:php`).

- NOTE: Set the server path mapping to the following:
* `/path/to/gravity-pdf/folder/* => /var/www/src/wp-content/plugins/gravity-forms-pdf-extended`
* `/path/to/gravity-pdf/folder/wordpress/ => var/www`


### Switch PHP Versions

By default, the latest stable version of PHP will be used when you start the Docker environment. To switch, set the environmental variable `LOCAL_PHP` to one of the following:

* `7.3-fpm`
* `7.4-fpm`

For example, to swap to PHP 7.4 run `export LOCAL_PHP=7.4-fpm` and then stop and start your container with `yarn env stop` and `yarn env start`.

## Setup without Docker

If you would rather use your own development environment, you can build Gravity PDF using the following commands. 

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/GravityPDF/gravity-pdf/`
1. Run `yarn prebuild` and `yarn build:production`
1. Run `composer install`
1. Run `bash ./bin/vendor-prefix.sh`

## Linting

To lint your JS code, use `yarn lint:js`. 

To lint your PHP code with Docker use:
```
yarn env docker-run php composer compat
yarn env docker-run php composer lint
yarn env docker-run php composer lint:errors
```

To automatically fix PHP lint errors, use `yarn env docker-run php composer format`

If you aren't using docker, omit `yarn env docker-run php` from the beginning of each command.

## Automated Tests

The automated test suite can only be run using Docker. 

## E2E

Useful commands include:

```
yarn test:e2e
yarn test:e2e:headless
```

## PHPUnit

To successfully run all PHPUnit tests you will need an Elite Gravity Forms license so the Survey, Poll, and Quiz plugins can be automatically installed and downloaded. To install these plugins, run `yarn env:install:phpunit`. 

You can then run full suite of tests using `yarn test:php` or `yarn test:php:multisite`

## JavaScript

The JavaScript unit tests can be run with `yarn test:js`

## Building JS

If you are making changes to any of the JavaScript or CSS, run `yarn build:watch:js` or `yarn build:watch:css` respectively to ensure the files automatically gets built when you make changes on the file system.

1. All PRs must be to the `development` branch.
1. Modifications of the existing codebase must pass unit tests.
1. Additions to the plugin must have appropriate E2E/unit tests written.
1. PRs that don't pass existing unit testing or do not have the proper tests to accompany the changes will not be merged.

If you are uncertain whether your PR meets all these requirements, don't worry! If there are problems our friendly team will guide you in the right direction.
