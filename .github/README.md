[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GravityPDF/gravity-pdf.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/GravityPDF/gravity-pdf) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/GravityPDF/gravity-pdf/branch/development/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/GravityPDF/gravity-pdf)

Gravity PDF is a GPLv2-licensed WordPress plugin that allows you to automatically generate, email and download PDF documents using the popular form-builder plugin, [Gravity Forms](https://rocketgenius.pxf.io/c/1211356/445235/7938).

# About

This Git repository is for developers who want to contribute to Gravity PDF. **Don't use it in production**. For production use, [download Gravity PDF from the WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-pdf-extended/).

The `development` branch is considered our bleeding edge branch, with all new changes pushed to it. The `master` branch is our latest stable version of Gravity PDF.

# Installation

Before beginning, ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed and their commands are globally accessible via the command line.

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/GravityPDF/gravity-pdf/`
1. Open your terminal / command prompt to the Gravity PDF root directory and run `composer install`. This command will automatically download all the PHP and JS packages, and run the build tools.
1. Copy the plugin to your WordPress plugin directory (if not there already) and active through your WordPress admin area

# Setup Local Docker Environment

A test site with Gravity PDF pre-configured can be automatically be built locally if you've Docker installed on available via the CLI. To setup:

1. Start Docker. Note: if running Local By Flywheel (or you need to start Docker manually), first run `docker-machine start`, then `eval $(docker-machine env)`.
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace `0000000000000000` with a valid Elite license key in `.env`
1. Run `./bin/setup-local-env.sh` from the command line
1. Access test site at `http://localhost:8888`, or the domain shown in the CLI if different. The username is `admin` and the password is `password`

# Contributions

You are more than welcome to contribute to Gravity PDF but we recommend you [open a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/GravityPDF/gravity-pdf/issues) and discuss your use-case before creating a pull request.

There are a few guidelines that need to be followed to ensure a smooth pull request. These include:

1. Adhere to the existing code standard which follows [WordPress standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/), with the exception of Yoda conditionals.
1. All PRs must be to the `development` branch.
1. Modifications of the existing codebase must pass all unit tests.
1. Any additions to the plugin must have appropriate unit tests written.
1. PRs that don't pass existing unit testing or do not have the proper tests to accompany the changes will not be merged.
1. Once our team is happy with the PR we'll ask you to squash your branch into a single commit, rebase it onto the development branch and push the changes to GitHub. This ensures we keep a clean Git history.

If you are uncertain whether your PR meets all these requirements, don't worry! If there are problems our friendly team will guide you in the right direction.

### Run Unit Tests

#### PHPUnit (PHP)

We use PHPUnit to test out all the PHP we write. The tests are located in `tests/phpunit/unit-tests/`

Installing the testing environment is best done using a flavour of Vagrant (try [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV)).

1. From your terminal SSH into your Vagrant box using the `vagrant ssh` command
2. `cd` into the root of your Gravity PDF directory
3. Run `bash tests/bin/install.sh gravitypdf_test root root localhost` where `root root` is substituted for your mysql username and password (VVV users can run the command as is).
4. Upon success you can run `vendor/bin/phpunit`, `vendor/bin/phpunit --group ajax` and `vendor/bin/phpunit --group slow-pdf-processes`.

#### Mocha (JS)

We use the JS libaries, [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) to test our Javascript and use [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) to run those tests in a variety of browsers. We also use [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) to help test ReactJS.

The tests are located in `tests/mocha/unit-tests/`.

Running the tests can easily be done with one of the following commands:

* `yarn run test` – runs all the tests once in PhantomJS
* `yarn run test:watch` – watches for changes to the tests and runs in PhantomJS
* `yarn run test:all` – runs all tests in Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer
 
### Building JS

We use Webpack to compile our Javascript from ES6 to ES5. If you want to modify the Javascript then take advantage of `yarn run watch` to automatically re-build the JS when changes are made.
